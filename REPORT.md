### For Further Research
1. **Expand dataset:** Test performance on full 70,000 sample dataset
2. **Feature engineering:** Explore interaction terms and polynomial features
3. **Ensemble methods:** Combine multiple models for improved performance
4. **External validation:** Test on different cardiovascular datasets

## Conclusion

This study successfully demonstrated that machine learning can effectively predict cardiovascular disease with good accuracy (72-73%) and discriminative ability (AUC-ROC ~0.79) even with a reduced dataset. The **Neural Network with Standardized features** achieved the best overall performance, while **Logistic Regression** provided the most stable and interpretable results.

The dataset reduction strategy proved effective, enabling rapid model development and comparison while maintaining representative performance. All three algorithms showed clinical utility, with the choice between them depending on specific requirements for interpretability, computational resources, and performance priorities.

**Key Finding:** Data preprocessing and transformation choices significantly impact model performance, particularly for SVMs and Neural Networks, emphasizing the importance of proper feature scaling in machine learning pipelines.
